**The Cyber Security Group (CSG)** is the cybersecurity lead for the Government sector. CSG's mandate is to protect the Singapore government's ICT systems and build a trusted digital government for Singapore.

To achieve this, CSG develops a holistic range of cybersecurity capabilities to support its various missions. These range from blue-teaming capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, to red-teaming capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities in Government ICT and Smart Systems.

Beyond cyber-defence capabilities, CSG also works with the owners of Whole-of-Government (WOG) and Smart Nation Programmes to implement secure architecture. 
CSG also works with Chief Information Security Officers in government agencies to provide cybersecurity governance and technical guidance. Together, these efforts help our Government build a safer and more secure Smart Nation.

CSG also engages with the broader cybersecurity ecosystem within Singapore in order to augment government capabilities. In the area of cyber research, CSG partners with the [National Research Foundation](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} and the [Cyber Security Agency of Singapore](https://www.csa.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} through the [National Cybersecurity Research and Development Programme (R&D)](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/programmes/national-cybersecurity-r-d-programme){:target="_blank"} to develop R&D expertise in cybersecurity. 
In the area of competency building, CSG has partnered with SingTel to conduct cybersecurity training programme for WOG security officers.

Besides industry partnerships, CSG works with members of the public through the Vulnerability Disclosure Programme and the Government Bug Bounty Programme to encourage responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities and weaknesses in government systems. 
Since 2018, CSG has conducted three Bug Bounty Programmes that has yielded 90 vulnerabilities across 24 applications.

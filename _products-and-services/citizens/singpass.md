[SingPass](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/spauth/login/loginpage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login){:target="_blank"}, which stands for Singapore Personal Access, is every Singapore resident’s digital identity. Through the SingPass national authentication system, residents get easy and secure access to a myriad of government and private sector services online, and in person. SingPass is managed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). 

### **Fast and convenient logins**

Users can log in to digital services conveniently by:
1. Using their fingerprint, face or an easy-to-remember password through their [SingPass Mobile app](https://go.gov.sg/spm){:target="_blank"}; or 

2. Entering their SingPass ID and password, followed by a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS.

This Two-Factor authentication (2FA) method provides an additional layer of security to better protect users’ personal data.

### **Seamless access to more services**

Since its launch in 2018, we have been progressively adding more useful features to the SingPass Mobile app. This include one-tap access to commonly-used government digital services and a customisable profile where users always have their important information on hand.

Beyond digital access, SingPass Mobile lets users prove their identity and provide personal information when transacting over the counters. Since December 2019, patients at Punggol Polyclinic and visitors to Republic Plaza are able to use their SingPass Mobile to register, in place of manual form filling.
To support contact tracing efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic, SingPass Mobile was enhanced to enable users to perform faster SafeEntry check-ins. Users can choose to scan the SafeEntry QR code with the in-app scanner or search for their location on the app.

As of August 2020, close to 1.9 million SingPass users are actively using SingPass Mobile. For even more convenient sign-ups, Face Verification has also been enabled in the app’s onboarding process. Users can now set up their SingPass Mobile app by simply using a face scan. This feature is particularly useful for users based overseas as they no longer need to wait for a physical PIN mailer or use their SMS-OTP before setting up SingPass Mobile.

### **Accessible for everyone**

Not only is SingPass designed with inclusiveness and accessibility from the start, GovTech has been actively improving the SingPass Mobile app based on public feedback gathered through user testing and [Tech Kaki](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community/){:target="_blank"} citizen engagement sessions.

GovTech also works closely with the Infocomm Media Development Authority on educating users who may need more assistance on the use of SingPass Mobile. Download the multilingual guide on setting up and using SingPass Mobile here:

### **Ever-improving Security Measures**

Along with 2FA, users should also play their part to protect their account and personal information. Here are some tips:
- Do not share login information: Keep your SingPass ID, password and 2FA details confidential.
- Do not re-use passwords: Certain websites that you access may not be secure. Log-in information may be stolen from these sites and used to hack your SingPass account.
- Be aware of phishing sites: Some sites may look like government websites to trick you into disclosing your personal details. Always check that the URL is correct (www.singpass.gov.sg) with a ‘lock’ icon in the address bar.
